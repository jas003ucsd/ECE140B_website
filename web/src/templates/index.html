    <h1>Automatic Grocery Inventory</h1>
    <p>
        Have you been to the grocery store forget if you had milk? Well, now you have
        no worries, with the automatic Grocery Inventory. This product will track
        what items that you have put in the refrigerator or cabinets. This inventory
        can be essay access by an app.
    </p>
    <p>
        This works by having a camera that is attached to the entrance to the groceries' storage area.
        When the cabinet is opened the camera is takes an image of the product entering. This image
        is processed with computer vision to identify the product. This item is entered into a database.
        The user than will be able to check what items are in the inventory. This data will then be able to
        retrieve from the app.

    I implimented the box layout from CSS videos. I did this by using box-sizing in the body.
  </p>
  <p>
     Once I had the border-box setup, I adjusted the padding and widths of the divs. To make each div unique I used the class name by ".classname" to uniquely style the div.
  </p>
  <p>
    I then used relevant sizing for the padding and widths by using rems. rems stand for root em. this means it takes its size form the root element.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, I applied the grid to display each of these each div side by side.
  </p>
  <p>
      I host the site on Digital Ocean. I attempt Heroku was of poor quality due to waiting for the
      dyno to spin up on the free teir, and Linode did not have a good tutorial. I build the site
      inside a docker image. The side runs on a pyramid backend with jinja to load webpages. I then
      linked to the style in a css folder in the public folder.
