        no worries, with the automatic Grocery Inventory. This product will track

        This works by having a camera that is attached to the entrance to the groceries' storage area.

  <h1> Learning about CSS </h1>
  <p>
    I implimented the box layout from CSS videos. I did this by using box-sizing in the body.
  </p>
  <p>
     Once I had the border-box setup, I adjusted the padding and widths of the divs. To make each div unique I used the class name by ".classname" to uniquely style the div.
  </p>
  <p>
    I then used relevant sizing for the padding and widths by using rems. rems stand for root em. this means it takes its size form the root element.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, I applied the grid to display each of these each div side by side.
